        <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr>
       <h2>Who I Am</h2>
       <p class="paragraph">I am 19 years old and from Monteagle, Tennessee, a small town about an hour outside of Chattanooga. I am currently a business major at Chattanooga State and will graduate with my associate’s degree in the spring. Along with being a student, I work in the gift shop of a very popular restaurant in my hometown, where I’ve been for a little over three years. If I had to describe myself in a few words, I’d say I am a dreamer, determined, a planner, and strong-willed.</p>
<hr>
       <h2>My Background</h2>
       <p class="paragraph">I graduated high school from South Pittsburg and have lived in the area all my life. I come from a very close-knit family who means the world to me, and they have played a big role in shaping who I am today. I have three sisters and my older sister just had a baby so I am now an Aunt! Recently, I became engaged, and I am so excited to marry my best friend and the love of my life.</p>

     <h2>My Goals</h2>
       <p class="paragraph">In the next two years, I see myself starting a new career. I’m open to different paths—whether that’s finding a stay-at-home job, starting a business, or even becoming a doula. I know I want to be married and building a family by then. I dream of having a garden, maybe even a small farm, and living a lifestyle rooted in health and sustainability. I’ve started removing toxic products from my life and love implementing healthy choices into my everyday routine. In the future, I hope to help others do the same.
