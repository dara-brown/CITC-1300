    <h1>The Great Smoky Mountains</h1>

    <h2>Explore the Great Smoky Mountains</h2>
    
    <p>The Great Smoky Mountains extend across Tennessee and North Carolina and are home to sixteen peaks over 6,000 feet, making them the tallest in the eastern U.S. These mountains are over 300 million years old and are filled with forests, waterfalls, streams, and wildlife. The Cherokee people once called this area “Shaconage,” meaning “place of blue smoke,” before many of them were forced out during the Trail of Tears. In the 1800s, small farming communities like Cades Cove were formed and today there are over 70 old cabins, churches, and schools that have been preserved. Later, logging took down much of the forest, but efforts to protect the land led to the national park being officially created in 1934. Today, the Smokies cover over half a million acres with miles of trails to explore and are home to thousands of plants and animals, including the popular black bears. With millions of visitors every year, it’s easy to see why the Smokies are one of America’s favorite places to visit.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>Although the Smokies are known for views, there are endless adventures and activates for everyone. You can hike the trails, drive through Cades Cove, or go to Clingmans Dome for some of the best mountain views around. All of these choices allow you to really experience the Great Smoky Mountains and all it has to offer. Always be on the lookout for wildlife but remember never to approach the wild animals. My favorite thing to do is to stop and see the horses when entering Cades Cove or getting out to explore the preserved historic buildings. What makes the park so special is that it’s more than just the scenery, it’s the peaceful feeling you get and the way it makes you feel connected to nature every time you visit.  </p>

    <h3>Planning your Visit</h3>
    <p>The towns around the Smokies each have their own charm and make it easy for visitors to access the park. Three of the most popular places to stay are Gatlinburg, Sevierville, and Townsend. Gatlinburg is the most lively, packed with shops, restaurants, and attractions like the SkyBridge and Ripley’s Aquarium. Sevierville, hometown of Dolly Parton, is known for its Tanger Outlets, dinner shows, and plenty of family-friendly activities. For a quieter, slower-paced trip, Townsend is the perfect spot, offering a peaceful atmosphere and lots of outdoor adventure. These towns matter because they’re not just gateways to the Great Smoky Mountains—they’re also where many visitors eat, stay, and plan their adventures, making them an important part of the overall Smoky Mountain experience. </p>
