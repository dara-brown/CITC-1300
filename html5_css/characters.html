        <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005028/" target="_blank">Andie Anderson played by Kate Hudson</a> </h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Andie Anderson, played by Kate Hudson, is a journalist at Composure magazine. She is creative and good at her job, but she feels stuck writing shallow articles when she rather write about more important topics. Her boss was not up for that, but she takes on a challenge to write about how to lose a guy in ten days by acting in all the ways that usually drive men away. She takes everything to the extreme on purpose, like excessively calling, moving too fast in the relationship, and being overly emotional. Even though she’s supposed to be “annoying,” her personality still comes across as fun and likable. Andie is very clever, funny, and confident which makes her an amazing lead character. Kate Hudson brings a lot of charm to the role as Andie, which is part of why people still remember it today.

        <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000190/" target="_blank">Ben Barry played by Matthew McConaughey</a></h3>
        
        <p>Ben Barry, played by Matthew McConaughey, is a advertising executive who likes a good challenge. In the beginning of the movie, he makes a bet that he can make any woman fall in love with him in ten days. He thinks it will be easy, but then he meets Andie, and nothing goes the way he planned because of the conflicting missions. Ben is determined to win the bet, so he puts up her. His reactions are some of the funniest parts of the movie because he has to try so hard to keep her falling for him. Throughout the movie, Ben starts to genuinely care about Andie, which makes the bet less important. Matthew McConaughey's charm and humor is what makes Ben such a great match for Andie. </p>
